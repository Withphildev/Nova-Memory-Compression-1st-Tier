# 💾 Nova Memory Compression – HYDRANGEA Tier 1

Welcome to the documentation site for **Nova Memory Compression**, the dual-mode AI memory engine that powers efficient, expressive storage.

> Part of **Nova OS (in development)** – designed to help AI preserve meaning, structure, and emotion under token limits.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Nova Memory Compression supports two optimized memory modes:

- 🧠 **Compact Mode:** Fast & lean — removes filler for automation or logs  
- 💫 **Expressive Mode:** Preserves tone and nuance — perfect for journaling or assistant memory

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

To run the compression engine:

```bash
python compression_engine.py input.txt output.csv --mode expressive
```

- Replace `expressive` with `compact` for minimal memory
- Input should be a `.txt` file with one memory line per row
