# Nova Memory Compression – 1st Tier

**Experimental AI memory compression and tagging system inspired by Nova's modular intelligence architecture.**

## 🚀 What This Is
This is a prototype for memory optimization in AI systems, designed to extend usable context and reduce token bloat via compression, threading, and tagging strategies.

## 🔍 Key Features
- High-efficiency memory compression (text-based)
- Tagging system for memory classification
- Multi-phase context threading (future update)
- Compatible with language models using token constraints

## 📂 Folder Structure
- `src/` – Experimental scripts and compression logic
- `docs/` – Architecture diagrams, logs, and planning notes
- `data/` – Sample files, inputs, and logs
- `README.md` – Project overview
- `LICENSE.txt` – License for open source usage (non-commercial only)

## 🛡️ License
This project is free for personal and educational use.  
**Companies or commercial users must obtain a license.**  
See `LICENSE.txt` for full terms.

## 📈 Future Plans
- Context-aware memory threading (multi-layer)
- Performance benchmarking suite
- Optional Web UI or plugin system
- GitHub Action to visualize test metrics
